<p>Hi.&nbsp; My name is Joe Coutcher, and if you couldn't tell by the name of my site, I'm a .NET developer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing software since I was 4 years old.&nbsp; Started out on a Commodore VIC-20 (the wonder computer of the 1980&rsquo;s), and ventured into the land of GWBASIC/QBASIC once we got our first x86 system.&nbsp; I started learning C++ and assembly at age 10, then moved into CGI and Classic ASP programming in high school.</p>
<p>I was just starting out in college when the .NET Framework was introduced, and thanks to my university offering VisualStudio.NET Student Edition for $30, I started playing around with it.&nbsp; I was immediately hooked.&nbsp; And years down the road, once&nbsp;.NET Core came out, I fell in love all over again!</p>
<p style="clear: both;"><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><br />My usual go-to development stack/libraries when producing ASP.NET projects are the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>.NET Core 5/ASP.NET Core</li>
<li>Angular 12/Typescript</li>
<li>Node/Express for simple apps/hackathons</li>
<li>Probably a lot more, but my brain is fried as I type this.&nbsp; Long day.&nbsp; :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to .NET and web development, I&rsquo;m decent with PHP, XML/XSLT/XSL-FO, Java, C++ and some Assembly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve also dabbled in Python and Prolog.<br /><br /><br />As for open source projects I&rsquo;ve worked on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jcoutch/NCrontab-Advanced" target="_blank">NCrontab.Advanced</a></strong> - a re-write of the NCrontab library with additional features (and backwards compatibility)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jcoutch/Hangfire.RecurringDateRange" target="_blank">Hangfire.RecurringDateTime</a>&nbsp;</strong>- a plugin for <strong><a href="https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/" target="_blank">Hangfire</a></strong> that allows you to specify start/end dates in addition to using cron strings to schedule jobs</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jcoutch/steel-battalion-net" target="_blank">steel-battalion-net</a> </strong>- A LibUSB library for reading signals from a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Battalion" target="_blank">Steel Battalion</a> </strong>controller on NetFX (on 64-bit Windows)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jcoutch/usg-scripts" target="_blank">usg-scripts</a> </strong>-&nbsp;A set of&nbsp;vbash scripts for use on the Unifi Security Gateway</li>
<li>I help out occasionally on projects from <strong><a href="https://github.com/DynamicTyped" target="_blank">DynamicTyped</a></strong></li>
<li>Wrote a <strong><a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=TrueSpace+Exporter" target="_blank">plug-in for TrueSpace</a></strong> for exporting models in the Ogre 3D Rendering Engine format</li>
<li>Initiated pull requests on a few libraries here and there</li>
</ul>
