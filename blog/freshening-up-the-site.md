I was getting tired of the old theme I had installed, and went back to the stock BlogEngine theme. &nbsp;Made the site a lot cleaner! &nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Also, I cleaned up the descriptions of the posts a bit so it's easier to navigate the home page. &nbsp;Maybe now that the site doesn't look like crap, I'll write more posts! &nbsp;;-)</span>
