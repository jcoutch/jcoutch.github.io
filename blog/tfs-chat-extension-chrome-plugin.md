<p>A while back, I wrote about a TamperMonkey script I wrote that added pop-up notifications to TFS Team Chat.&nbsp; While that was a nice feature, I just couldnâ€™t leave it there.&nbsp; So I incorporated it into an extension.</p>  <p><a title="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tfs-chat-extensions/lnkmcjeibjfompohbcjfkimjijajiadd" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tfs-chat-extensions/lnkmcjeibjfompohbcjfkimjijajiadd">TFS Chat Extensions</a></p> Some features I've added to the original script:   <ul>   <li>Popup notifications for messages </li>    <li>Image embedding (jpg/png) by simply pasting the url </li>    <li>Animated GIF support (disabled by default) </li>    <li>Code Syntax Highlighting (using markdown's ``` var i = 0; ``` syntax) </li>    <li>YouTube embedding </li>    <li>Changeset referencing (by using #cxxxx syntax, where xxxx is the changeset number. i.e. #c1234 will change into a link stating "Changeset 1234" that will take you directly to the changeset info page) </li> </ul>  <p>If you have the original TamperMonkey script installed, uninstall it before installing this plugin.</p>  <p>Let me know how you like it!&nbsp; If you have any suggestions for new features, you can pass them along, or you can contribute to the open-source <a href="https://github.com/nuts4dotnet/TFSChatExtensions">Github</a> project!</p>
