# Nuts4.NET

This repository is an archive of the original Nuts4.NET website.  Considering I haven't written 
any new articles for a couple years, it didn't make sense to pay for hosting when I could store
my blog posts on GitHub for free.  Plus, the core demographic of my blog likely knows how to
navigate GitHub and markdown documents. :-)
